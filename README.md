## NBA Top 4 Team Prediction Project
### Project Overview
###### This project aims to predict which NBA teams will rank among the top 4 using team performance data from 2012 to 2022. By leveraging machine learning models and various optimization techniques, this analysis assesses historical performance to forecast future standings effectively.

### Data Source
###### The dataset comprises team performance statistics from the 2012 to 2022 NBA seasons. Data was collected and processed to provide a comprehensive view of each team's performance metrics over the years.

### Methodology
#### Machine Learning Models
###### The project experiments with several machine learning models to determine the most effective predictor of top 4 teams:

###### ‧ Logistic Regression
###### ‧ Naive Bayes
###### ‧ Decision Tree
###### ‧ Random Forest
#### Performance Metrics
###### Model performances were evaluated using the following metrics:

###### ‧ Accuracy
###### ‧ F1 Score
###### ‧ Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)
###### ‧ Area Under the Curve (AUC)

#### Optimization Techniques
###### To enhance model performance, various optimization methods were employed:

###### ‧ SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) - To handle imbalanced data by generating synthetic samples.
###### ‧ Pre-pruning and Post-pruning - To avoid overfitting by limiting the size of the decision tree.
###### ‧ AdaBoost and GradientBoost - To improve prediction accuracy through boosting techniques.
###### ‧ Feature Importance - To identify and rank the most influential features.
###### ‧ Cross-Validation - To ensure the model's robustness and generalizability across different data subsets.
### Results and Discussion
###### The project's findings highlight the effectiveness of ensemble methods and feature engineering in predicting the top 4 NBA teams. The results are discussed in detail, comparing the performance across different models and configurations.
